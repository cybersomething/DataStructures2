# DataStructures2

# Please do not plaigirise this work - it taken me a long time to work on this, please use it as a guide or for inspiration :) 

This is the final version of the coursework I created for data structures and algorithms 2.

The PDF contains the slides that were used as part of the presentation, on this you can see the algorithm I chosen and how I was able to implement multithreading and mutexes to do this faster.
